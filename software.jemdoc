== Softwares
I have developed and currently maintain the following software. You can get the latest version from my [https://github.com/ChongWu-Biostat GitHub repository].

- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prclust/index.html prclust]: R package that provides two algorithms for fitting the penalized regression-based clustering (PRclust). The corresponding paper is [http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-553/15-553.pdf Wu, Kwon, Shen and Pan, 2016].
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MiSPU/index.html MiSPU]:  R package that presents a novel global testing method called aMiSPU, that is highly adaptive and thus high powered across various scenarios, alleviating the issue with the choice of a phylogenetic distance. The corresponding paper is [https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0302-3 Wu, Chen, Kim and Pan, 2016].
- [https://github.com/ChongWu-Biostat/GLMaSPU GLMaSPU]: R package that makes it incredibly easy to implement some testing methods under high-dimensional generalized linear models. The corresponding paper is our 2019 Stat Sinica paper. 
- [glmtlp.html glmtlp]: R package that makes it easy to implement the truncated lasso penalty under a generalized linear model framework. This package is similar to [https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html glmnet] but can be applied with a non-convex penalty. 

~~~
To help researchers from other field use our newly developed method, we have created and maintained the following software and pipeline. We assume no prior knowledge in R and all the following software can be run easily and smoothly once the required packages are installed. Please send me an email ï¼ˆcwu3@fsu.edu) if you have find any bugs when using them.

- [IWAS.html IWAS]: A software for implementing Imaging-Wide Association Studies (IWAS). The corresponding paper is [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28736311 our 2017 NeuroImage paper].
- [TWAS.html TWAS-aSPU]: A more powerful gene-based association test to integrate single set or multiple sets of eQTL data with GWAS individual-level data or summary statistics. The corresponding paper is [http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/early/2017/09/11/genetics.117.300270.full.pdf our 2017 Genetics paper].
- [aspupath2.html aSPUpath2]: A new pathway-based method for integrating eQTL data with GWAS summary statistics. This can be viewed as an extension of TWAS to the pathway-based analysis. The corresponding paper is [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29411426 our 2018 Genetic Epidemiology paper].
- [egmethyl.html egmethyl]: A new gene-based test for integrating enhancer-promoter interactions and DNA methylation data with GWAS summary data. The corresponding paper is [https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz161 our 2019 Bioinformatics paper].

We create a [https://github.com/ChongWuLab GitHub lab page] for the software written by the group members
~~~

- [https://github.com/ChongWuLab/CMO CMO]: Cross Methylome Omnibus (CMO) integrates genetically regulated DNAm in enhancers, promoters, and the gene body to identify additional disease-associated genes.
- [https://github.com/ChongWuLab/FOGS FOGS]: FOGS is  a powerful fine-mapping method that prioritizes putative causal genes by accounting for local LD in TWAS results
