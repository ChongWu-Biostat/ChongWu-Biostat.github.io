== Short Bio
Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.stat.fsu.edu Department of Statistics] at [https://www.fsu.edu Florida State University]. Prior to FSU, I was a biostatistics Ph.D. student at the [http://twin-cities.umn.edu University of Minnesota], co-advised by Profs. Weihua Guan and [http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/  Wei Pan]. I received my bachelor's degree in Applied Math from [http://english.hust.edu.cn Huazhong University of Science and Technology] in 2013.

My research interests are in statistical genetics and genomics, statistical learning, and machine learning. In the past a few years, I have obtained a diverse training in developing statistical methods and algorithms for analyzing multiple types of genetic and genomic data, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, DNA methylation data, and human microbiome data. My work includes gene- and pathway-based association testing and a new algorithm for clustering. To practice and facilitate reproducible research, I have developed and currently maintain several software and their online manuals ([software.html see Software page]). My recent work involves integrative analysis of GWAS with multiple sources of omics data.

~~~
I have extensive experience in analyzing genetics and genomics datasets (e.g., UK Biobank data, GTEx data, ARIC data, etc.). If you want to conduct GWAS or related research, you can contact me.

I am seeking highly self-motivated students to join my research group. If you are interested, feel free to email me or stop by my office.
