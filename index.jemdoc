== Short Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.stat.fsu.edu Department of Statistics] at [https://www.fsu.edu Florida State University]. Prior to FSU, I was a biostatistics Ph.D. student at the [http://twin-cities.umn.edu University of Minnesota], co-advised by Profs. Weihua Guan and [http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/  Wei Pan]. I received my bachelor's degree in Applied Math from [http://english.hust.edu.cn Huazhong University of Science and Technology] in 2013.

My research interests are in statistical genetics and genomics, statistical learning, and machine learning. I have obtained diverse training and experiences in developing statistical methods and algorithms for analyzing multiple types of genetic and genomic data, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, DNA methylation data, and human microbiome data. My work includes gene- and pathway-based association testing, integrative -omics analysis, new algorithms in clustering, Mendelian randomization, and polygenic risk scores. To practice and facilitate reproducible research, I have developed and currently maintain several software (most in R packages) and their online manuals. My recent work involves integrative analysis of GWAS with multiple sources of omics data.
