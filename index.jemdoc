== Intro
Chong Wu is an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/biostatistics.html Department of Biostatistics] at [https://www.mdanderson.org The University of Texas MD Anderson]. His research focuses on developing a new generation of data-driven methods and software to address challenges imposed by big and messy genomics data. Briefly, his research aims at 1) identifying putative causal biomarkers to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex diseases, particularly prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer's, and 2) enhancing risk predictions to advance precision medicine.
